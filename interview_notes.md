## Software Development Methodologies

Agile scrum methodology 
* is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.
