## Slide 1: Intro - Dale

Hello, good evening everyone. We are group one and we’re here to present our 2020 intern project challenge.
My Name is Draven Dale Calabia , … (yous introduce yourselves)….
Our topic of discussion is as you can see on the screen. In short, we’re being asking, what do we believe that future workforce will look like post-covid 19 and how important we think it is to maintain social interactions.
To further strengthen our points, we’ve made a short survey that we gave to our colleges and friends outside of fidelity. And you’ll hear us reference this survey throughout our presentation.


## Slide 2: the new Normal - Sophie

Within 2 weeks fidelity ireland went fully remote, meaning approximately 1100 employees are working from home. The covid 19 pandemic has affected us all yet fidelity;s quick thinking and agile workforce kept up momentum and proved that with the right equipment and constant streams of communication and support we are able to work efficiently from home without damaging fidelitys reputation or customer satisfaction. 

My internship experience will differ to any past fidelity interns as I never got to see the office. I started in fidelity in mid april in the height on the pandemic. I was fully on boarded virtually meaning hours of intense online training using tools such as teams and zoom. On average fidelity use up to 4million zoom minutes a day worldwide which shows the constant stream on communication and level of interactions the company still have day to day.

Im very lucky to have gained the experience of working through covid 19 as many other college student had their internships cancelled as they business was unable to give adequate training virtually. The fact that fidelity were hiring and not firing over the last few months shows that even though working from home may be the new normal its business as usual. 

## Slide 3: How will decentralised teams collaborate? - Graham

Collaboration Day:

If everyone in the team is able to travel to the office, a collaboration day may be implemented. This involves everyone in the team meeting in the office and they are supplied with a respectively sized fully equipped room with collaboration tools inside. E.g: Whiteboard, desks, Zoom conference setup for anyone missing. This would not require a permanent office presence as it may be once a week or month.

Does not require permanent office presence

## Slide 4: How will decentralised teams collaborate? - Graham

No point wasting time, keep it short as it needs to be.

Use the tools given to you to your advantage

Allows team members who are non critical to the meeting at hand work on other stuff 

Keeping the group on topic is the most important thing, keeps momentum going

## Slide 5: Technologies and Tools - Lara

Fidelity already provides fantastic tools and resources to its associates 
It's important to acknowledge that 
So much can be done with them
and they May not being used at their best
So, Before thinking about new tools:	
Train people on the capabilities of the existing tools to use them on their extent

## Slide 6: Technologies and Tools - Lara

We have some suggestions of tools that may be needed:

Time management
For People may need help to schedule breaks and their lunch time, for example
Maybe provide Kanban board to create To Do lists
Fidelity can Help people to get Focus time using tools like: 
Pomodoro technique
uses a timer to break down work into intervals
Divided by short breaks


2. Screen recording or Screen to GIF
Quickly record something and send in teams

3. Mobile hot spots
Support Work from anywhere
We suggest using the corporate phones or BYOD program to achieve that


4. Pair Working
When you’re in the office, it’s easy to sit behind someone and what they working on
Online, it’s can be hard to do that – requires a zoom meeting, screen share, sometimes Zoom crashes, etc.
The ideal solution would be that you people can see the changes being in real time, each on their own laptops
This would make it easier to shadow someone working, learning a new tool and to pair program
Looking into Visual Studio Live Share:
Shared codebase but each person to navigate and work independently
Voice included


5. Workspace
Printer, scanner and locker depending on their role
Desk and chairs - Ergonomics and well being of associates
Suggestion: there are lots of local Ireland designers – Through CSR, Partner with them, selection of sizes and models, promoting local business

## Slide 7: Social Interaction - Ali

Social Interactions are extremely valued within organisations. As you can see from our survey results social isolation and communication with co-workers are major challenges that people face from WFH. Not only are social interactions good for your mental health, but they also help with productivity. The happier you are, the more likely you are to be productive.
 It is important to note that not every associate is living with their family or friends, so their social interactions in the workplace may be the only ones they have day-day. Therefore, it is vital that we maintain social interactions across dispersed teams and take advantage of our readily available collaboration tools that provide face-face contact like zoom or skype. Face-face contact is essential for creating relationships with one another.

## Slide 8: Work-Life Balance - Monika

Setting up a good work-life balance can be difficult so we have a few tips for you guys. 
Wake up and get up – make sure you AVOID staying in bed until the very last minute (as tempting as it may be). Getting up and out of bed will make you feel more awake.  
  
Have breakfast – DON'T switch on your laptop the first thing after you wake up. As they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day and eating it while sitting in front of your screen will NOT help you get a good start to the day.  
  
Take regular breaks – Sitting in front of a screen will make your eyes extremely tired. Take a 10-15 minute break every couple of hours or whenever you're starting to feel tired. GET UP and do a few stretches or get a drink. 
  
Now the most important one "Go home" on time - It's important to know when to stop working. There has been an increase in the amount of people doing extra hours just because they don't have that commute home anymore. So, as tempting as it may be to "write a few more lines of code" or "send one more email" - you can do it the next day  
  
Also, a suggestion we had while discussing this topic was to have workshops for employees on how to set up a good routine so that might be something worth looking into. 


## Slide 9: Physical and Mental Wellbeing while Working-from-home - Brian

1.       By virtue of the fact that we do need ‘travel to the office’, many end up engaging in considerably less physical activity while working-from-home.
Such basic physical activity like walking to and from ones car/ to and from public transport or while on lunch break are eliminated while at home.  As such, people’s mental wellbeing can be hindered considerably should physical activity be reduced.
2.       Teams can implement regular exercise challenges/ team-goals, making use of apps such as MMR and Strava to encourage greater physical activity while working from home. Although offices will be reopening and peoples activity will increase -we feel these events should be encouraged for those who favour working from home and will continue to do so. 
 
3.       There are many resources available online that can help negate the negative effects of working from home e.g. people who are sitting at a kitchen table all day could make use of Online yoga sessions to help with back pain as a result.
 
4.       Many rely on meals offered by Fidelity in the canteens – a forum where people can deposit meal ideals could have a positive impact on those who choose to continue WFH.
 
5.       Managers could organize meetings between, which as such should be informal – just to check up on others and enforce ‘casual collisions’ and daily life that would be discussed about in the office. This would help establish a rapport further with networks. 
 
6.       While in the office, it may be easy to see when someone is having an ‘off-day’, which is impossible to see while at home. Frequent check ups with managers/ qualified persons where employees engage in open dialoue regareding their mental health could be beneficial.


## Slide 13: Work environment - Lara

In our survey we discovered that even though people want to work more from home 
Office still plays an important role 
More than 60% said want to come in once or twice per week

Time in the office:
That means that time in the office becomes Valuable
To make the most out of it, it Needs planning:
Scrum Master / Manager
Get as people many in
Activities that require collaboration and creativity
Not only work
 lunch, coffee
Suggestion: come up with a “Booking system” for hot desks desks 
Team can sit together for that day
People miss just turning around and asking a question to their coworkers


## Slide 14: Our Onboarding Experience - Ali

In office onboarding:

The onboarding process is crucial for organizations to get right as they need to create a positive first impression for their new hires.  They need to familiarize their new employee with the organization’s culture, polices, benefits, training available and help form social connections with colleagues. 
Both Sophie and I had completely different onboarding experiences. I had my onboarding in the office, which started with a daylong induction event for all the Interns. The event included presentations giving an overview on Fidelity, Risk Management, IT, Project Team and HR. A networking breakfast and lunch was also organized for all the Interns to get to chat to each other and break up our day. 
On the same day, I was given the opportunity to get introduced to my Team and see where I would be working in the office. My onboarding continued with my Team organizing 1-1’s with me for training. I found the in-office onboarding positive as I was able to build a relationship with my team from day one and found it easier to be able to have my questions answered instantly. 


## Slide 15: Your Home Workspace - Monika

Setting up a good home workspace can help you stay focused during the day,  
So here’s a few things you should consider. 
  
First of all – have a dedicated space – set up a desk for your laptop, monitors and other equipment. This can be in your bedroom or in a different room  
  
Next – Make sure that your workspace is clean and comfortable. Try not to have any distractions lying around.  
  
Next – make sure you have good back support. Where possible avoid sitting on the couch all day. Not having good back support can have horrible effects on your posture and will make you feel tired  
  
Open a window – make sure that if it’s possible you open a window in the room that you’re working from. This lets fresh air in and helps you keep a clear mind throughout the day. 
  
And lastly – have a drink at your desk. Staying hydrated is overlooked when working from home. It can be easy to get up and get a glass of water or a coffee while in the office but once we're stuck at home we often forget about taking drinks regularly.
