## Slide 1 - Dale

Hello, good evening everyone. We are group one and we’re here to present our 2020 intern project challenge.
My Name is Draven Dale Calabia , … (yous introduce yourselves)….
Our topic of discussion is as you can see on the screen. In short, we’re being asking, what do we believe that future workforce will look like post-covid 19 and how important we think it is to maintain social interactions.
To further strengthen our points, we’ve made a short survey that we gave to our colleges and friends outside of fidelity. And you’ll hear us reference this survey throughout our presentation.
