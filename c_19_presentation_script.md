## Slide 1: Intro - Dale

Hello, good evening everyone. We’re the first group and our group name is Quaranteam. and we’re here to present our 2020 intern project challenge. My Name is Dale and I’m joint with Ali, Lara, Sophie, Graham, Brian and Monika.

Our topic of discussion is as you can see on the screen. what do we believe that future workforce will look like and how important it is to maintain social interactions.

To further strengthen our points, we’ve made a short survey that we gave to our colleges and friends outside of fidelity. And you’ll hear us reference this survey throughout our presentation.

## Slide 2: Survey - Dale

So We believe that working from home will play a vital role in the future.
And in our survey, we asked What are the TOP THREE biggest challenges you are currently facing while working remotely? 
So we gave them a bunch of some options to choose from.

And the top 3 problems were Communication, keeping a regular schedule and your work environment. We based our solutions and Ideas of our presentation around these 3 points.

## Slide 3: The New Normal - Sophie

Within 2 weeks fidelity Ireland went fully remote, meaning approximately 1100 employees are working from home. The covid 19 pandemic has affected us all yet fidelity’s quick thinking and agile workforce kept up momentum and proved that with the right equipment and constant streams of communication and support we are able to work efficiently from home without damaging fidelity's reputation or customer satisfaction. 

My internship experience will differ to any past fidelity interns as I never got to see the office. I started in fidelity in mid April in the height on the pandemic. I was fully on boarded virtually meaning hours of intense online training using tools such as teams and zoom. On average fidelity use up to 4million zoom minutes a day worldwide which shows the constant stream on communication and level of interactions the company still have day to day.

I'm very lucky to have gained the experience of working through covid 19 as many other college student had their internships cancelled as they business was unable to give adequate training virtually. The fact that fidelity were hiring and not firing over the last few months shows that even though working from home may be the new normal its business as usual. 

## Slide 4: How will decentralised teams collaborate? - Graham

Collaboration Day:

If everyone in the team is able to travel to the office, a collaboration day may be implemented. This involves everyone in the team meeting in the office and they are supplied with a respectively sized fully equipped room with collaboration tools inside. E.g: Whiteboard, desks, Zoom conference setup for anyone missing. This would not require a permanent office presence as it may be once a week or month.

* Team available to travel
* Team meet in equipped room with collab tools
* Does not require permanent office presence

## Slide 5: How will decentralised teams collaborate? - Graham

* No point wasting time, keep it short as it needs to be.
* Use the tools given to you to your advantage
* Allows team members who are non critical to the meeting at hand work on other stuff 
* Keeping the group on topic is the most important thing, keeps momentum going

## Slide 6: Technologies and Tools - Lara

* Fidelity already provides fantastic tools and resources to its associates 
* It's important to acknowledge that 
* So much can be done with them
* and they May not being used at their best
* So, Before thinking about new tools:	
    * Train people on the capabilities of the existing tools to use them on their extent

## Slide 7: Technologies and Tools - Lara

We have some suggestions of tools that may be needed:
1) Time management
* For People may need help to schedule breaks and their lunch time, for example
* Maybe provide Kanban board to create To Do lists
* Fidelity can Help people to get Focus time using tools like: 
	* Pomodoro technique
		* uses a timer to break down work into intervals
		* Divided by short breaks


2) Screen recording or Screen to GIF
* Quickly record something and send in teams

3. Mobile hot spots
* Support Work from anywhere
* We suggest using the corporate phones or BYOD program to achieve that


4) Pair Working
* When you’re in the office, it’s easy to sit behind someone and what they working on
* Online, it’s can be hard to do that – requires a zoom meeting, screen share, sometimes Zoom crashes, etc.
* The ideal solution would be that you people can see the changes being in real time, each on their own laptops
* This would make it easier to shadow someone working, learning a new tool and to pair program
* Looking into Visual Studio Live Share:
	* Shared codebase but each person to navigate and work independently
	* Voice included


5) Workspace
* Printer, scanner and locker depending on their role
* Desk and chairs - Ergonomics and well being of associates
* Suggestion: there are lots of local Ireland designers – Through CSR, Partner with them, selection of sizes and models, promoting local business

## Slide 8: Social Interaction - Ali

Social Interactions are extremely valued within organisations. As you can see from our survey results social isolation and communication with co-workers are major challenges that people face from WFH. Not only are social interactions good for your mental health, but they also help with productivity. The happier you are, the more likely you are to be productive.  
 It is important to note that not every associate is living with their family or friends, so their social interactions in the workplace may be the only ones they have day-day. Therefore, it is vital that we maintain social interactions across dispersed teams and take advantage of our readily available collaboration tools that provide face-face contact like zoom or skype. Face-face contact is essential for creating relationships with one another.   
  
As you can see from the slide, there are many suggestions for maintain social interactions within dispersed teams.   
Coffee breaks and lunches are things that we definitely took for granted while we were in the office, as they were a given. To try and bring that sense of normality back to dispersed teams, coffee breaks and lunches could easily be organised through zoom.  
Organising a team collaborative activity may be another option, for example my team took part in a 'Bake Off' - which was something different from the norm, created purpose to the social interaction and brought about some healthy competition amongst us.   
(1 minute & 15 secs)..   

## Slide 9: Work-Life Balance - Monika

Setting up a good work-life balance can be difficult so we have a few tips for you guys. 
Wake up and get up – make sure you AVOID staying in bed until the very last minute (as tempting as it may be). Getting up and out of bed will make you feel more awake.  
  
Have breakfast – DON'T switch on your laptop the first thing after you wake up. As they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day and eating it while sitting in front of your screen will NOT help you get a good start to the day.  
  
Take regular breaks – Sitting in front of a screen will make your eyes extremely tired. Take a 10-15 minute break every couple of hours or whenever you're starting to feel tired. GET UP and do a few stretches or get a drink. 
  
Now the most important one "Go home" on time - It's important to know when to stop working. There has been an increase in the amount of people doing extra hours just because they don't have that commute home anymore. So, as tempting as it may be to "write a few more lines of code" or "send one more email" - you can do it the next day  
  
Also, a suggestion we had while discussing this topic was to have workshops for employees on how to set up a good routine so that might be something worth looking into. 


## Slide 10: Physical and Mental Wellbeing while Working-from-home - Brian

1. By virtue of the fact that we do need ‘travel to the office’, many end up engaging in considerably less physical activity while working-from-home.

Such basic physical activity like walking to and from ones car/ to and from public transport or while on lunch break are eliminated while at home.  As such, people’s mental wellbeing can be hindered considerably should physical activity be reduced.

2. Teams can implement regular exercise challenges/ team-goals, making use of apps such as MMR and Strava to encourage greater physical activity while working from home. Although offices will be reopening and peoples activity will increase -we feel these events should be encouraged for those who favour working from home and will continue to do so. 
 
3. There are many resources available online that can help negate the negative effects of working from home e.g. people who are sitting at a kitchen table all day could make use of Online yoga sessions to help with back pain as a result.
 
4. Many rely on meals offered by Fidelity in the canteens – a forum where people can deposit meal ideals could have a positive impact on those who choose to continue WFH.
 
5. Managers could organize meetings between, which as such should be informal – just to check up on others and enforce ‘casual collisions’ and daily life that would be discussed about in the office. This would help establish a rapport further with networks. 
 
6. While in the office, it may be easy to see when someone is having an ‘off-day’, which is impossible to see while at home. Frequent check ups with managers/ qualified persons where employees engage in open dialoue regareding their mental health could be beneficial.


## Slide 11: Work environment - Lara

* In our survey we discovered that even though people want to work more from home 
* Office still plays an important role 
* More than 60% said want to come in once or twice per week

Time in the office:
* That means that time in the office becomes Valuable
* To make the most out of it, it Needs planning:
	* Scrum Master / Manager
	* Get as people many in
	* Activities that require collaboration and creativity
* Not only work
	*  lunch, coffee
* Suggestion: come up with a “Booking system” for hot desks desks 
* Team can sit together for that day
* People miss just turning around and asking a question to their coworkers


## Slide 12: Our Onboarding Experience - Ali

Ali – In office onboarding: <br>
The onboarding process is crucial for organizations to get right as they need to create a positive first impression for their new hires.  They need to familiarize their new employee with the organization’s culture, polices, benefits, training available and help form social connections with colleagues. 

Both Sophie and I had completely different onboarding experiences. I had my onboarding in the office, which started with a daylong induction event for all the Interns. The event included presentations giving an overview on Fidelity and a networking breakfast and lunch which was also organized for all the Interns to get to chat to each other and break up our day. 

Unlike Sophie, I was given the opportunity to get introduced to my Team in person and see where I would be working in the office. My onboarding continued with my Team organizing 1-1’s with me for training. I found the in-office onboarding positive as I was able to build a relationship with my team from day one and found it easier to be able to have my questions answered instantly.  (55 secs)


Sophie- <br>
As I mentioned earlier, I was one of the interns that was onboarded virtually. Like everyone else we had to adapt to change. Our first day was a full day of presentations from members of the hr and risk team. Prior to this we were split out into breakout rooms to try build relationships with the other interns. The majority of my training for the cash reconciliation team was done over zoom. My normal day for the first 6-8 weeks would be to log on to a zoom chat at 8:30 break for an hour at lunch and then log back in until half 5. 8hr zoom calls 5 days a week can become draining and repetitive which is why myself and ali have thought of a few suggestions

Buddy Scheme (sophie) 
  * A person on your team or even another intern that you can turn to if you need a catch up or break like ali had mentioned previously a virtual coffee break or lunch to keep up those day to day interactions and have a positive effect on efficient working and mental health, your buddy would be there if you have any questions you need answered 
 
Virtual – risk & compliance training (sophie) 
* We also believe another approach to online training may be beneficial. We think that a mix of zoom calls and use of other platforms like udemy may help break up the day and still be just as effective. When starting in fidelity we all had to take time out of our day to do personal risk and compliance training through fidelity central.what we are proposing is that by using personal deployment tools like udemy that new employees may be able to learn theory behind the process before using zoom or pair programming like lara had mentioned to develop knowledge and skills



## Slide 13: Your Home Workspace - Monika

Setting up a good home workspace can help you stay focused during the day,  
So here’s a few things you should consider. 
  
First of all – have a dedicated space – set up a desk for your laptop, monitors and other equipment. This can be in your bedroom or in a different room  
  
Next – Make sure that your workspace is clean and comfortable. Try not to have any distractions lying around.  
  
Next – make sure you have good back support. Where possible avoid sitting on the couch all day. Not having good back support can have horrible effects on your posture and will make you feel tired  
  
Open a window – make sure that if it’s possible you open a window in the room that you’re working from. This lets fresh air in and helps you keep a clear mind throughout the day. 
  
And lastly – have a drink at your desk. Staying hydrated is overlooked when working from home. It can be easy to get up and get a glass of water or a coffee while in the office but once we're stuck at home we often forget about taking drinks regularly.  

## Slide 14: Including everyone in the team - Graham

We already know: 
* Diversity and Inclusion is a huge part of Fidelity's core principles.
* We believe the future workforce will be as diverse and as equal as possible

What we might not already know:
* With the future work force being a mix of WFH and Office work, improving this will enable even more inclusion than already possible and allow potentially fully remote work. 
* Working from home can help people who may face difficulty getting to the office.
* If a team member must stay at home for a day, it will be easier to collaborate with them as the team is already efficiently trained for remote collaboration.

## Slide 15: Diversity in Fidelity  - Brian

* We currently live in times of severe social volatility, and it is now more than ever we need to come together, albeit virtually, and celebrate the Fidelity’s vastly diverse workforce. 
* Fidelity offers a plethora of resource groups and events that help to celebrate and support the ever-growing diversity within the organisation – examples of which are; ASPIRE - which enables employees to enhance their connection to the Black/AA/Latino/Hispanic cultures, Fidelity Pride (LGBT+ community) and Fidelity Enable which focuses on the inclusion and empowerment of those working with disabilities. 
* WFH makes it difficult to organise events celebrating diversity and enhancing inclusivity in the company. Many events are held in the office to further acknowledge and celebrate the various cultures, backgrounds and minorities and spread across the organisation. Such events give employees opportunities to embrace diversity, but the same ‘buzz’ around these events would wain virtually but should definitely continue as normal. 
* Fidelity have been very proactive in supporting Racial Equity in the past few months while working from home . Associates have donated in excess of $480,000 to the Fidelity Foundation – which the organization has matched twofold summing to $1.44m in donations. Emails and notices sent by the company encouraging further donations to the foundation could be hugely beneficial.


## Slide 16: Summary - Dale

Going back to the question “What do you believe the future workforce will look like”

We believe that WFH is the future. And if executed well, it’ll be a huge benefit moving forward. 
Before, WFH was sort of thought of as a special exception and now we think that its more of an option that everyone can choose from.


Our main solutions throughout the presentations were 
* collaboration day
* Planning a routing, have daily events and workshop
* Utilize diversity recourses and have suitable work from equipment


And these points kind of ties in with the second part of the topic question asking how important is social interaction. And we think these 3 points has a huge effect on interact socially. It can have big impact in how an individual could work, their mental health and their daily routine. 

The end goal is replicate the kind of communication you’d have in an office but at home.
	
And we think that these points help that. 


## Slide 17: Outro - Dale

That is our presentation we are group Quaranteam, Thank you very much for listening. And we’d be happy to answer any questions.
