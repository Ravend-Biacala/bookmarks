## Slide 1: Intro - Dale

Hello, good evening everyone. We are group one and we’re here to present our 2020 intern project challenge.
My Name is Draven Dale Calabia , … (yous introduce yourselves)….
Our topic of discussion is as you can see on the screen. In short, we’re being asking, what do we believe that future workforce will look like post-covid 19 and how important we think it is to maintain social interactions.
To further strengthen our points, we’ve made a short survey that we gave to our colleges and friends outside of fidelity. And you’ll hear us reference this survey throughout our presentation.


## Slide 2: the new Normal - Sophie

Within 2 weeks fidelity ireland went fully remote, meaning approximately 1100 employees are working from home. The covid 19 pandemic has affected us all yet fidelity;s quick thinking and agile workforce kept up momentum and proved that with the right equipment and constant streams of communication and support we are able to work efficiently from home without damaging fidelitys reputation or customer satisfaction. 

My internship experience will differ to any past fidelity interns as I never got to see the office. I started in fidelity in mid april in the height on the pandemic. I was fully on boarded virtually meaning hours of intense online training using tools such as teams and zoom. On average fidelity use up to 4million zoom minutes a day worldwide which shows the constant stream on communication and level of interactions the company still have day to day.

Im very lucky to have gained the experience of working through covid 19 as many other college student had their internships cancelled as they business was unable to give adequate training virtually. The fact that fidelity were hiring and not firing over the last few months shows that even though working from home may be the new normal its business as usual.
